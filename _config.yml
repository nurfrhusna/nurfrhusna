  I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Yonsei University, South Korea. 
  I am passionate about Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), front-end development, and user
  experience design (UX Design).

  Living and studying in South Korea has thought me to embrace cultural diversity, adaptibility,
  and creativity. I enjoy learning through projects that combine logic, design, and empathy-bridging 
  technical skills with human-centered problems-solving.

      Outside if academics, i find joy in photography - capturing nature, architecture, and everyday life moments around Seoul.

      I also enjoy journaling and traveling, often lending my love for storytelling and visuals to document ny experience abroad.
      These hobbies keep me grounded and inspired to continue growing as both a learner and creator.
